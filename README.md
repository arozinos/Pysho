# Pysho
A small script to look up the latest thing in your clipboard in an online dictionary

Hello everyone.
I made a small script that accesses the last entry in your clipboard and then inputs it into jisho.
For optimized use, I recommend the jisho-pitcher addon. This script is specifically useful if you have a stream
deck or something like that. You'll also need to pip install pyperclip using the command line (pip install pyperclip) 
It's quite simple, a 2 minute YouTube tutorial should help you out if you don't know what you're doing.
Have fun sentence mining!
